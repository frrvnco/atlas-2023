	"description": "\"Tula\" is the name given to a Chilean energy drink. Initially, it started as a meme back in the distant year of 2007, when a group of friends created a humorous video for a school project, featuring a mock commercial for the drink. The joke revolves around the fact that \"Tula\" is a slang term used in Chile to refer to the male reproductive organ. Years later, in 2019, a company began marketing this beverage under the curious name.",
